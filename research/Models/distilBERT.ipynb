As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \\\"golden anniversary\\\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \\\"Super Bowl L\\\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.\""
